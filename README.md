# What is Masterdex?

Masterdex v2 is a virtual Pokedex in the form of a progressive web app that contains highly detailed data on all Pokemon from the game series up until the 8th generation. This is a remake of my first ever React project, [Masterdex](https://github.com/LoneHippie/masterdex).\

Made with React and Sass, all Pokemon data taken from [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Features

Users can search for pokemon individually by name, or get multiple results for a specific type (ie fire, water, psychic, etc) or generation (game generation) of pokemon. Each pokemon has a display stylized according to it's type which contains in depth information on it's height, weight, abilities, moves (can view generation differences between movepools for a single Pokemon), stats and evolution chain.
